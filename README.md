## How was the proxies’ speed and success rate testing done?

<details>
  <summary>Click for speed testing</summary>

Residential proxies’ average response time and success rate provided in our website are based on Proxyway’s research. Proxyway is an independent educational platform dedicated to the research and testing of proxy providers and services. Our shared DC and DDC proxies were tested using Python requests and time libraries by noting the time before sending a request and after receiving a response. We sent 500 requests per endpoint to the http://ipinfo.io/ip website. After receiving 500 HTTP 200 response codes, we divided the total time by 500 to determine the average response time. Requests were sent from the same country’s VPN as the endpoint is. The test was conducted using a rotating session type with Python 3.9.6. version.

## How do shared datacenter proxies work?

<details>

Shared datacenter proxies route your internet traffic through servers located in data centers. These servers act as intermediaries between you and the websites you visit, masking your real IP address and providing you with a different IP.

## How do private datacenter proxies work?

<details>
  <summary>Click for private datacenter</summary>

Dedicated datacenter proxies (a.k.a private datacenter proxies) work as shared datacenter proxies, and additionally they provide exclusive and private IP addresses sourced from data centers. Dedicated datacenter proxies offer enhanced privacy and performance with reliable and uninterrupted access, as each IP is dedicated to a single user.

## How fast are datacenter proxies?
